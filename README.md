# Mastering A/B Testing


### Table of Contents

1. Gameplan for Intermediate A/B Testing
    --> Learn the step-by-step approach for structuring intermediate A/B tests, focusing on defining hypotheses, experimental setups, metrics, and result evaluation.
    --> Emphasis on identifying common pitfalls and ensuring robust testing procedures.

2. Case Study: Amazon’s Buy Button Briefing
    --> A real-world example analysing how changes to Amazon’s buy button impacted user behaviour and conversions.
    --> Insights into testing design, measuring incremental changes, and interpreting results.

3. Bayesian A/B Testing
    --> Introduction to Bayesian principles for A/B testing.
    --> Explanation of posterior probability, priors, and how Bayesian methods differ from traditional frequentist approaches.
    --> Learn why Bayesian methods are powerful for decision-making in uncertain environments.

4. Bayesian Statistics
    --> Dive into the foundation of Bayesian statistics, including the Bayes theorem formula, alpha/beta priors, and how priors influence posterior distributions.
    --> Examples of beta distributions and their applications in A/B testing.
   
5. Proportions Test
    --> Understand how to test for differences in proportions between control and treatment groups.
    --> Step-by-step implementation and interpretation of proportion test results to measure statistical significance.

6. Sequential Testing and Early Stopping
    --> Learn the concepts of sequential testing, where results are monitored continuously during the experiment.
    --> Understand early stopping rules, their benefits, and potential risks, especially in reducing Type I and Type II errors


### Advanced Case Studies and Statistical Methods

7. Case Study: Netflix’s Wednesday Thumbnails Briefing
    --> Analysing the impact of different thumbnail designs for Netflix’s hit series "Wednesday".
    --> Detailed walkthrough of A/B/C tests and how multiple variations can be effectively analysed.

8. A/B/C Testing
    --> Extending A/B testing to multiple groups (e.g., A, B, C).
    --> Learn to compare variations and their relative performance using proportion-based analysis and continuous variable analysis.

9. Chi-Square Test
    --> Use the chi-square test to evaluate whether observed categorical data matches expected distributions.
    --> Applications in comparing user preferences across different groups.

10. Bonferroni Method
    --> Understand how the Bonferroni correction helps control the family-wise error rate in multiple comparisons.
    --> Practical examples and implementation in the context of A/B testing.

11. ANOVA Test and Tukey’s HSD Test
    --> Learn how to perform an ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test to compare means across multiple groups.
    --> Dive into Tukey’s HSD Test for post-hoc analysis, identifying which groups differ significantly after ANOVA detects a difference.
